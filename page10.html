                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><div>The term manipulation often refers to psychological manipulation. Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that uses indirect, deceptive, or underhanded tactics to change the behavior or perception of others. Such methods could be considered exploitative and devious because they advance the manipulator's interests at the expense of others. When mind games are used to control a relationship, this is known as psychological manipulation. There's also a secondary goal: to undermine, perplex, and bring down the target. Emotionally abusive relationships and bullying behavior are built on these tactics. The signs can be subtle, they appear and disappear, and those who use them are highly skilled. You can be deceived in many ways. Some who manipulate you will want to know all about you. Manipulators frequently begin with flattery. They'll show a lot of interest in you and ask a lot of questions, some of which will be light, but others will be deep and probing. You'll find that opening up makes you feel more interesting, even fascinating. The questions posed by a manipulator have an agenda. They're gathering all of your insecurities and vulnerabilities to use against you when it's convenient for them. Their behavior is inconsistent. You get emotionally manipulated by praising you and putting you back down on a complete cycle. A manipulator often guilt trips. This is when you're forced to prove your love or devotion to someone by doing things for them, such as doing chores or favors for them, or taking on extra work/hours. The manipulator frequently plays the victim, making you appear to be the bully, assailant, or simply Difficult Employee. You may hear lines like (how could you do that to me?), (if you really loved me you would…), or (If you really wanted to get ahead you would…). When being manipulated, you are often blamed. When you object to a hurtful or stinging remark, a manipulator will say you're being overly sensitive, overreacting, or have lost your sense of humour. They might say, (Calm down) or (It was just a joke). A manipulator would target things you can’t change and make to put you in an upset and uncomfortable position. They will probably gaslight you. The manipulator sows doubt in their target's mind, causing them to doubt their own reality: their memory, perception, and judgment. They might make you wonder if it was all in your head, if you're overreacting, if you're the crazy one, or if you're losing your mind.</div><div><br></div><div>Some signs of emotional manipulation are as follows. They can also ask probing questions which may have you lower your guard and share your concerns. This often happens in business relationships. They will also twist facts by lying or omitting facts. This enables them to seem more vulnerable and sincere. They also utilise intellectual bullying by making you seem inferior. They might say (You’re new to this, so I wouldn’t expect you to understand). They might make you feel sorry for voicing your concerns and make them feel like they are the victim, not you. They might say (I don’t know why you just don’t trust me). They may say just joking to mask mean behavior. They can also use your insecurities against you. If they know your insecurities they can use them against you by saying, (This is a tough audience. I’d be nervous if I was you).They will also make themselves appear as a martyr. They may sound eager to do something but then do whatever it takes to get out of helping. They could say (This is harder than it looks. I don’t think you knew that when you asked me). They may also guilt trip you or give you an ultimatum. They could say (If you can’t be here this weekend, I think it shows your level of dedication to this office) or (If you don’t show we’re done!).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Manipulative behaviour involves three factors: fear, obligation and guilt. A bully makes you feel fearful and might use aggression, threats and intimidation to control you. Manipulators do not normally bully or threaten but play the victim. A person who is targeted by manipulators who play the victim often tries to help the manipulator in order to stop feeling guilty. Targets of this kind of manipulation often feel responsible for helping the victim. A manipulator would gaslight you to make you question yourself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is a thin line between online persuasion and online manipulation. Persuasion nudges you to come to a conclusion but so does manipulation. What really is the difference? American author Nir Eyal stated “We build products meant to persuade people to do what we want them to do. We call these people “users” and even if we don’t say it aloud, we secretly wish every one of them would become fiendishly addicted.”. How is persuasion different from manipulation? Facebook manipulated the content seen by more than 600,000 users in an attempt to see if they could affect their emotional state. They skewed the number of positive or negative items on random users' news feeds. The publication of these results led to massive backlash.&nbsp;</div><br><div>Takeaways:</div><br><div>Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that uses indirect, deceptive, or underhanded tactics to change the behavior or perception of others.
